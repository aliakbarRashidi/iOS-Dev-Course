###Required Tasks1. ~~Add a tab bar controller to your application. One tab will be the game you built lastweek in Assignment 1. The other tab will be a new game, Set. Set is still a cardgame, so a good solution to this assignment will use object-oriented programmingtechniques to share a lot of code.~~ 
2. ~~Don’t violate any of the Required Tasks from Assignment 1 in the playing card gametab (in other words, don’t break any non-extra-credit features from last week). Theonly exception is that your playing card game is required to be a 2-card-match-onlygame this week, so you can remove the switch or segmented control you added forRequired Task #5 in Assignment 1. Your Set game is a 3-card matching game.~~3. ~~The Set game only needs to allow users to pick sets and get points for doing so (e.g. itdoes not redeal new cards when sets are found). In other words, it works just likeyour other card game (except that it is a 3 card (instead of 2 card) match withdifferent kinds of cards)~~
4.~~Choose reasonable amounts to award the user for successfully finding a set (orincorrectly picking cards which are not a set).~~
5. ~~Your Set game should have 24 cards.~~
6. ~~Instead of drawing the cards in the classic form (we’ll do that next week), we’ll usethese three characters ▲ ● ■ and use attributes in NSAttributedString to drawthem appropriately (i.e. colors and shading).~~
7. ~~Your Set game should have a Deal button, Score label and Flips label just like yourplaying card matching game from Assignment 1 does.~~
8. ~~Your Set game should also report (mis)matches like Required Task #3 in Assignment 1, but you’ll have to enhance this feature (to use NSAttributedString) to make itwork for displaying Set card matches.~~
###Extra 
1. ~~Create appropriate icons for your two tabs. The icons are 30x30 and are pure alphachannels (i.e. they are a “cutout” through which the blue gradient shines through).Search the documentation for more on how to create icons like that and set them.~~2. ~~Add third tab to track the user’s scores. It should be clear which scores were playingcard match games and which scores were Set card match games.~~
